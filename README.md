NOTE: This project is not complete.

See above links for more information about the data. It's the COVID-19 data source used by the White House, as well as CNN, The New York Times, WSJ, Politico, and many more channels.

For those not familiar, my research is stored in a format called "Jupyter Notebook" (file extension '.ipynb'). Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive way of using Python to display data structures. You can view my project here on GitHub without needing to install any software by viewing the .ipynb files in this repository. The code is commented well, so even if you've never seen Python, you'll be able to follow along. The hash ('#') symbol indicates a comment I've written to help readers follow along. Some of these comments are technical... you can ignore those.
